# About this project
this is a recreation of one of my old front end projects: [Label Engine](labelengine.io).  
I upgraded the loading speed by implementing **lazy loading** and loading screens and also added **theme switch** feature.  
The original project was made using:  
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **jQuery**  

while this one is made using

- **React**
- **React-router**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **TypeScript.**
